<dl>
<dt><b><a name="General0">1.1. What is a FITS file?</a></b></dt>
<dd>See the
<a href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/">
FITS support office home page
</a>
at NASA for more informations about this file format.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="General1">1.2. How do I reduce infrared data?</a></b></dt>
<dd>Contact an infrared expert to get training. Reducing infrared data is
no trivial task. The ISAAC pipeline tools are trying to make your life
easier by automating some of the tedious tasks involved, but they do
not replace the know-how of a trained astronomer. Read books, ask
around you, read the ISAAC manual, etc. A good idea is usually to get
training on infrared observing before actually submitting your
proposals, or at least make sure you can get in touch with somebody
who can help you process your data.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="General2">1.3. Can you help me reduce my data?</a></b></dt>
<dd>Short answer: <b>NO</b>
<p>
Long answer: the <b>eclipse</b> team is dedicated to provide pipeline
tools to the community to help them reduce their data. We are by no
means an absolute reference about infrared data reduction.
<p>
If you happen to find a bug or have comments about the methods offered
by the pipeline, you are welcome to contact us:
<b>eclipse-team AT eso DOT org</b>.
<p>
If you have problems with your data, you are invited to contact the
User Support Group in Garching to clarify points related to data
acquisition.
<p>
If you have problems understanding what should be done on your data,
you need expert assistance. The <b>eclipse</b> team can unfortunately
not provide that level of service. The User Support Group might give
you hints. Reading all ISAAC documentation might be a good idea too.
See the ISAAC Data Reduction Guide (from the ISAAC or <b>eclipse</b>
home page).<br><br></dd>

<dd>Read the manual accessible from the eclipse home page.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="General4">1.5. What is a pipeline recipe exactly?</a></b></dt>
<dd>This question is answered in the general eclipse FAQ.<br>
See also question below: "I heard some horrible things about jitter, what
is true?".<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="General5">1.6. May I use it for optical data?</a></b></dt>
<dd>You can of course use this software on optical data. Actually, number of
people have been using it as a shift-and-add tool for images taken in
the visible bands. The most sensible thing to do in this case would be
to disable the sky estimation in the ini file, but otherwise algorithms
are unchanged.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="General6">1.7. I heard some horrible things about jitter, what is true?</a></b></dt>
<dd><i>jitter</i> is a very complex tool that is aimed at performing the
data reduction steps with as little user interaction as possible. In an
ideal future, it should be able to modify itself its internal parameters
depending on the input data, to get the best possible results. But that
is still a dream! Today you need to first read the documentation
carefully to be sure you understand correctly what the input parameters
are. Then you need to take the time to study your own case and define a
correct set of parameters for your problem. Then you can run
<i>jitter</i> and see if the results you get are consistent. The best
data reduction ever is almost never achieved on the first attempt.
<i>jitter</i> is not (yet!) a magical tool that does everything for you.
<p>
<i>jitter</i> is trying to be a good tool, not a good worker. There is
no replacement so far for the attention an astronomer can have on a data
set, and the scientific appreciation of the results. Consider this
software as a transparent box that automates many tasks for you but has to
be tailored to your data sets to produce the most efficient results.<br><br></dd>

<hr><h2>2. Input and configuration files</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b><a name="Input and configuration files0">2.1. Are there examples of jitter.ini files?</a></b></dt>
<dd>Use the <tt>-g</tt> or <tt>--generate</tt> option. It will produce a
default <tt>jitter.ini</tt> file in the current directory.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Input and configuration files1">2.2. What are the default parameters valid for?</a></b></dt>
<dd>Section by section:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>SkyEngine</li>
	<p>
	Default parameters are set for a slowly varying sky, i.e. the sky
	can be considered constant in time over a range of
	2*RejectHalfWidth+1 frames. If you are observing in J or H with a
	total exposure time of 1 second per frame, it is reasonable to set
	the half-width of the running filter to a high value. If you are
	observing in K or Ks and have a long exposure time per frame, do not
	use values above 2 or 3 as half-width, the assumption of a constant
	sky in time is not valid anymore.
	</p>
<p>
	<li>Shift and add</li>
	<p>
	Default behaviour is to look for cross-correlating objects
	automatically, locate a small number of objects around the center of
	the first frame, and refine the inputs given by the FITS headers.
	Frame shifts are by default performed by resampling using a
	hyperbolic tangent kernel for interpolation. The only average
	method is filtered, rejecting a user-specified number of min and max
	pixels on each time line before averaging.
	</p>
<p>
	<li>Post-processing</li>
	<p>
	Default is to apply subtraction of the median from each row, to take
	care of saturation effects. No image viewer is launched at the end
	by default.
	</p>
</ul><br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Input and configuration files2">2.3. How much memory do you recommend to have?</a></b></dt>
<dd>It depends on the amount of data you have to process. A typical SOFI or
ISAAC batch of jitter files is usually made of about 60 frames. That
translates to roughly 256 megs in input, thus about 512 megs
total memory consumption during the process. If you can afford a
gigabyte of RAM for such data sets, do it. If you have less
memory, <i>jitter</i> will create its own swap pages as necessary to
make the best use of what you have.
<p>
For your information: <i>jitter</i> has been reported to reduce such
SOFI batches on a Solaris station with only 32 megs of RAM (and loads
of disk space), without any problem. The process is considerably
slower, but it runs fine. I would say that 32 megs in RAM is the
minimal amount to get a decent working <i>jitter</i> process. If you
have a slow machine or little RAM, launch your processes at night with
an <tt>at</tt> or <tt>cron</tt> command and get the results in the
morning.
<p>
Do not push it too far, though. The memory handling mechanism in
<b>eclipse</b> is able to deal with far more memory than you truly
have (RAM chips + swap space on disk) because of this internal swap
page mechanism. But it cannot allocate infinite resources. You might
still run out of memory in the following cases:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>No more disk space available on <tt>E_TMPDIR</tt>.</li>
	<li>Too many opened files at the same time.</li>
	<li>Your memory consumption has reached the limit set by your
	shell configuration (<tt>limit datasize</tt>).</li>
	<li>You have exhausted all possible pointers on a 32-bit machine
	(no kidding this has already happened).</li>
	<li>The output file you are trying to create is bigger than the
	maximum size for this filesystem.</li>
	<li>Your kernel has run out of resources (no more pointers, size
	of static structures reach a maximum, etc.).<li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are many things that might fail if you are trying to launch
processing of huge data sets, and there is nothing that can be done to
prevent that. If you really need to run <i>jitter</i> on very large
numbers of frames, you are probably doing something wrong anyway. See
below about combining several data sets together.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Input and configuration files3">2.4. How do I create the list of input files?</a></b></dt>
<dd>The simplest way is to use <tt>'ls'</tt>.
<p>
<pre>
% ls -1 *.fits > framelist.ascii
</pre>
<p>
Replace <tt>*.fits</tt> by the wildcards you need to describe the
files you want to process, and <tt>framelist.ascii</tt> by any name you
want, provided it is declared correctly in <tt>jitter.ini</tt>.
<p>
Notice that <tt>ls</tt> is used with the option -1 (minus one), which
requests a list of file names on a single column output.
<p>
<b>Beware!</b>
<p>
If your <tt>ls</tt> command is aliased to some exotic combination of
options (most people alias <tt><b>ls</b></tt> to <tt><b>ls -F</b></tt>),
the results of the previous commands may append some funny characters to
the file names. Simple example: if your files have executable
permission, and you aliased <tt>ls -F</tt>, all file names will have
stars (*) appended, which will prevent <tt>jitter</tt> from finding
the files. Notice that you can de-alias a command by preceding it with a
backslash, i.e.
<p>
<pre>
% \ls -1 *.fits > myframelist
</pre>
<p>
If you want to do jitter+offset reductions, you will need to declare in
second column the file type for each input frame (see next question).
Hint: use <b><tt>dfits</tt></b> and <b><tt>fitsort -d</tt></b> to create
this column output. For ISAAC, the simplest is to do:
<p>
<pre>
    % dfits *.fits | fitsort -d DPR.TYPE > framelist.ascii
</pre><br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Input and configuration files4">2.5. Is it Ok to put several data sets in the same frame list?</a></b></dt>
<dd>Short answer: <b>NO</b>
<p>
Long answer:
<p>
Here is an example: you have observed the same field during several
nights, getting in the end N data sets, each of them containing
typically 30 to 60 frames. Since you want to get an image of the field
that includes all of your observations, you are wondering if you could
give all these files to <i>jitter</i> to magically re-combine them to
a single image.
<p>
Well... this is not possible. Several reasons:
<p>
<ol>
	<li>The sky subtraction will not work. You will have in the input
	list some consecutive frames taken widely apart in time. The sky
	filtering algorithm assumes a smooth (if not continuous) sky
	variation among frames, this breaks this assumption.</li>
<p>
	<li>The offsets declared in the header will not match. The rule is
	to declare every first frame in every batch being at offset (0,0).
	Now if you observe the first frame in each batch, you will see
	that they are not all exactly aligned, particularly if two data
	sets have not been taken the same night. This will bias the offset
	inputs and might lead to whole data sets not cross-correlating.
	</li>
<p>
	<li>Whatever machine you are running <i>jitter</i> on will most
	likely run out of memory during the process. Just realize that you
	have given the program several hundred megabytes to process, with
	a total requested load of about 2 times the size of your input
	data. Now check out how much memory you have on your machine and
	be more realistic.</li>
</ol><br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Input and configuration files5">2.6. So how to I combine several data sets of the same field?</a></b></dt>
<dd>The simplest solution is to reduce each batch separately, since each
batch is consistent with itself and <i>jitter</i> is made for that.
You will get one reduced frame per batch. Now you can combine these
together using again <i>jitter</i>, but this time you need to disable
the sky estimation and provide your own frame offsets, or if you have
an idea of the maximal offset range, activate the automatic offset
finder with large enough search sizes.
<p>
Agreed, this means that your frames will get interpolated a second
time, but this should not be an issue. First, each reduced frame has
already a quite high signal to noise ratio, which ensures that
re-sampling will not act randomly. Second, there are by definition no
very high frequencies in astronomical images because the acquisition
system has been designed so. Re-sampling is not likely to cause
artefacts with well-behaving signals like these.
<p>
If you are really worried about re-sampling the frames a second time,
you can always work on the offsets between all frames to make them
consistent relative to the first one in the batch. You will have to
find a way of subtracting the sky in each batch to produce
correctly sky-subtracted frames. And then you can try putting all your
frames into the same framelist... and hope that your machine does not
crash due to memory/CPU load.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Input and configuration files6">2.7. How do I declare <b>OBJECT</b> and <b>SKY</b> frames?</a></b></dt>
<dd>The input list format is the following: provide the input file names in
first column, and optionally the file type in second column. Both
columns are separated by blanks or tabs. The file type in second column
identifies whether the frame is an <b>OBJECT</b> or a <b>SKY</b>. The
definition is: if the word <b>sky</b> (case-insensitive) can be found in
the character string identifying the file type, then the frame is a sky.
Otherwise it is an object.
<p>
Examples
<p>
<pre>
The following declares only objects:
(no second column -> no <b>sky</b> string -> no SKY plane)
<p>
--- begin
frame1.fits
frame2.fits
frame3.fits
frame4.fits
--- end
<p>
The following declares frame2.fits and frame4.fits as skies:
(their second column contains a <b>sky</b> string)
<p>
--- begin
frame1.fits
frame2.fits sky
frame3.fits
frame4.fits sky
--- end
<p>
Same for the following:
<p>
--- begin
frame1.fits   OBJECT_FRAME
frame2.fits   SKY_FRAME
frame3.fits   OBJECT_FRAME
frame4.fits   SKY_FRAME
--- end
<p>
Same for the following
(notice that the second column is case-insensitive to identify 'sky')
<p>
--- begin
frame1.fits   NGC9999 
frame2.fits   NGC_SKY 
frame3.fits   NGC9999 
frame4.fits   skyFrame
--- end
</pre>
<p>
With SOFI/ISAAC frames, you can get away with a simple:
<p>
<pre>
    % dfits *.fits | fitsort -d DPR.TYPE > framelist.ascii
</pre><br><br></dd>

<hr><h2>3. Sky estimation/subtraction</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b><a name="Sky estimation/subtraction0">3.1. Why all these dark crowns in output around extended objects
or crowded regions?</a></b></dt>
<dd>During sky background estimation, the aim is to remove all objects from
the sky background, to get something which is as close as possible to
the real sky value. If this rejection does not work too well, there will
be star signal left in the background. This background is then
subtracted from all input frames, which means a signal which is a little
bit negative in case some object signal was left in the background.
<p>
This will happen for example if you have crowded regions. The jitter
movements are not sufficient (most will end up on object signal). For
some pixels, most observed signal will be object signal, not sky. In
that case it becomes impossible to filter reliably the sky out from this
signal.
<p>
<b>Warning!</b>
<p>
<i>It is a terrible idea to observe a very crowded field or an
extended object with a simple jitter pattern. Use instead
jitter+offset, it has been designed for that purpose. Of course, you
are then spending observation time to observe a blank sky, but it is
the only reliable way to get rid of this strong signal in the infrared
regime.
</i>
<p>
There have been many cases already of observers who did not want to
loose any time observing such useless signals as the sky, and were
totally unable to reduce their data. If you have not calibrated the
sky background, you are left out with atmosphere models to estimate
it, without any guarantee of result. You are advised not to use the
'jitter' command in such cases.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Sky estimation/subtraction1">3.2. How good is the sky-subtraction?</a></b></dt>
<dd>The sky-subtraction algorithm has been carefully studied by Angela
Iovino. Her results are presented in a report available from the eclipse
Web site.
<p>
Have a look at
<A HREF="http://www.eso.org/eclipse/jitterphot/">
jitter and photometry report</A><br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Sky estimation/subtraction2">3.3. How do I submit new sky-subtraction methods?</a></b></dt>
<dd>On average, we receive one new suggestion about sky filtering methods
per week (no kidding). On average, there is also one valid suggestion
every thousand. If you really think you have the ultimate
sky-filtering algorithm, it is recommended to go to your favourite
programming environment and try out your method. If you can prove on a
reasonable set of data that your method is better than the current
one, pack everything into a decently written report and send it to us.
<p>
An algorithm does not have to be <i>believed</i> but
<i>demonstrated</i>.  Just as you would not publish a scientific paper
where you only quote your opinions, you want to prove that your method
is working in a given domain with some restrictions and specified
parameters. If you just want to make suggestions, make sure they are
properly documented and the result of a scientific study, not just
your own belief.
<p>
The next step is then to try to convince us of your method. There are
too many suggestions about this topic for us to examine unsufficiently
argumented ones, so be convincing!<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Sky estimation/subtraction3">3.4. Where is the sky background estimation?</a></b></dt>
<dd>The sky background estimation is given in the output QC PAF file.
Have a look at your <tt>jittered_results_qc.paf</tt> file to get these
measurements. Notice that there is no option any more to convert
these values to other units, you will have to do it yourself. The given
values are the measured average sky background values during sky
estimation/subtraction.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Sky estimation/subtraction4">3.5. How is the sky estimated in jitter+offset mode?</a></b></dt>
<dd>To summarize: a batch of jitter+offset frames usually means a small number
of object and sky frames (10-20 at most). <i>jitter</i> will create a
single sky plane by taking the median average of all sky frames in input,
then subtract it from all object frames.
<p>
This method is Ok to provide a quick-look on the data set (which is what
the pipeline is meant to do), but insufficient in many cases. In K band,
the sky sometimes varies too fast for this method to provide a reliable sky
plane. You might want to produce several sky planes in this case, combining
them with whatever 3d filter seems appropriate to get a good estimate. It
is definitely recommended to measure sky background variations on the sky
frames before deciding on a way to filter them.
<p>
Once you have correctly subtracted out the sky, you can give the frames to
<i>jitter</i> as you would with raw frames, disabling of course the sky
estimation feature.<br><br></dd>
</dl>
<hr><h2>4. Shift and Add</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b><a name="Shift and Add0">4.1. How do I create an offset list?</a></b></dt>
<dd>Everything you need to know about offset lists can be found by launching
<i>jitter</i> with the <tt>--offset</tt> option.
<p>
Here is one way to create simple offset lists. The easiest is to create it
from header information. Using dfits, fitsort and awk you could do
something like:
<p>
<pre>
% dfits *.fits | fitsort -d seq.cumoffsetx seq.cumoffsety
</pre>
<p>
That prints out the values of SEQ.CUMOFFSETX and SEQ.CUMOFFSETY for all
FITS files in the current directory. Now if you want to create an offset
list from this, you also need to add the plane number, which is usually
just sequential from 1 to NPlanes. Using awk, you can easily add that by
doing:
<p>
<pre>
% [...] | awk '{print NR-1,$2,$3}' > offsets.in
</pre>
<p>
<tt>[...]</tt> stands for the previous command, combination of dfits and
fitsort.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Shift and Add1">4.2. <i>jitter</i> fails to find any object for cross-correlation.
What should I do?</a></b></dt>
<dd>Try the following tricks:
<ul>
	<li>Reducing the value of <i>AutoThreshold</i> will increase
	detection. Careful: decreasing this value too much will end up
	detecting noise and consequently increase the risk of false
	matches.</li>
<p>
	<li>It might be that no bright object is situated within the inside
	box in the first frame. To overcome that, you can try to increase
	the size of the possible box by decreasing the cross-correlation
	search area or measure area. If your input offsets are coming from
	the FITS header, reduce in the <tt>[ShiftAndAdd]</tt> section the
	following values:
	<ul>
		<li><tt>OffsetSearchSizeX</tt></li>
		<li><tt>OffsetSearchSizeY</tt></li>
		<li><tt>OffsetMeasureSizeX</tt></li>
		<li><tt>OffsetMeasureSizeY</tt></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
Last resort: if 'jitter' is still unable to find anything worth
cross-correlating in your images, of if the objects it picks are not
suitable for alignment (e.g. moving objects), you can provide your own
list of objects in an ASCII file. See the corresponding sections in the
jitter.ini file.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Shift and Add2">4.3. What if I am missing the first frame?</a></b></dt>
<dd>This should not change anything. <tt>jitter</tt> will identify the
offsets between frames anyway, and the final reconstructed frame will
be a union of all input frames (i.e. a bigger image than the input
images).<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Shift and Add3">4.4. What is the meaning of the returned value in parentheses, after the
offset values?</a></b></dt>
<dd>The typical output from the offset matching routine is something like:
<p>
<pre>
from plane 1 to plane 18:       [-4.24  -54.42] (25.42)
from plane 1 to plane 19:       [-57.44 -28.21] (33.38)
from plane 1 to plane 20:       [ 1.96  45.27]  (1396.27)
from plane 1 to plane 21:       [-18.35 -27.00] (35.13)
from plane 1 to plane 22:       [-37.79 -44.23] (1396.86)
from plane 1 to plane 23:       [37.00  41.88]  (25.61)
</pre>
<p>
The 'jitter' command determines offsets between frames by using a
cross-correlation criterion. This measurement is searching for an
offset between the reference and the candidate frame, that minimizes
the sum of squared differences between the frames. The value printed
out in parentheses along with the offset measurements is the minimal
difference value found in cross-correlation. The smaller the value,
the better the match between frames. The theoretical limit for this
value is zero (perfect match) in the case of a frame that is shifted
by an integer translation vector. There is no absolute reference to
measure the "goodness of match" with this value, since it will depend
on:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>The fractional displacement amount: it will increase the
	difference as displacements are closer to a half-pixel, and
	decrease as they get closer to integer pixels.</li>
	<li>The noise present in the image.</li>
	<li>The amount of signal in the image.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To have a visual indication of what this value is, you can have a look
at the jitter algorithmic manual:
<a href="http://www.eso.org/projects/dfs/papers/jitter99/node11.html">
http://www.eso.org/projects/dfs/papers/jitter99/node11.html</a>
<p>
The figure shows what a cross-correlation matrix looks like. The value
returned in parentheses by the 'jitter' command is the lowest value of
this matrix (the minimum of difference).
<p>
As a rule of thumb, the values you get should all be more or less
consistent. The lower the better, but the most important is to get
variations in this distance measurement as small as possible.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Shift and Add4">4.5. What kind of errors should be expected due to shift-and-add?</a></b></dt>
<dd>There are several sources of errors in the whole process. Let us review
them one by one.
<p>
Cross-correlation is failing on a number of signals. If your image exhibits
a strong periodical pattern, any replica in the pattern might be a good
candidate for cross-correlation, introducing large matching errors in the
output. A solution is to increase the size of the measurement area until
the reference zone does not exhibit any periodical pattern.
<p>
Another source of errors could be that the object used for
cross-correlation reference is elongated (e.g. a galaxy). In the direction
of elongation, any position is as likely to be picked as another. This
would introduce systematic errors like an elongation of all stars in the
final image. If you happen to be in such a case, try picking yourself the
main object used for correlation, e.g. a bright star that can be seen on
all frames. You could also increase the number of objects used in
cross-correlation to compensate errors.
<p>
Resampling is not completely harmless. A new signal is derived from the
input signal, using some assumptions in the process like signal smoothness.
If you happen to have very high frequencies (typically bad pixels) this is
likely to disturb the neighbouring pixels and introduce some errors in
final pixel values. If your signal behaves correctly and smooth enough, you
should not have introduced any noise at all through resampling, though.
<p>
The final stacking of images is also applying a 3d filter to remove the
highest and lowest pixel values before summing up. This will systematically
remove faint signals that appear on few frames, which might not be what you
want to do. If you are interesting in keeping all input signal in the
output, you should try linear averaging for the stacking and filter out bad
pixels by yourself. Be aware that removing pixels systematically might be a
cause of bias if your signal behaves irregularly.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Shift and Add5">4.6. Which method is used to shift the images?</a></b></dt>
<dd>The images are shifted using a high-order 2d separable interpolation
algorithm. Integer shifts are to be avoided because of the aliasing
they create.
<p>
There is an article about image resampling, containing a fair
description of what the interpolation scheme is. You should have a look
at the ESO Messenger (issue 100 - July 2000). The article is called:
<b>Astronomical image resampling</b>. You can download the July 2000 issue
of the Messenger from the ESO Web site, at:

<dt><b><a name="Shift and Add6">4.7. What is the 3d averaging algorithm?</a></b></dt>
<dd>The final stacking is done by sorting out all pixels belonging to the
same time line (z axis on the final cube), removing a user-specified
number of min and max pixels, and averaging the rest. <tt>jitter</tt>
used to offer various algorithms to do that, but this one is
definitely the best. If you want to use a simple linear stack
algorithm, you can set the reject numbers to 0,0. If you want to use a
median filter, you can set the reject numbers so that only the middle
value is kept.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Shift and Add7">4.8. Why is the final frame bigger than any input frame?</a></b></dt>
<dd>This change occurred in eclipse version 4. The default behaviour for
the command is to try to reconstruct a union of all input frames. If
you have small offsets between frames, this means that the final
stacked image will be 10 to 15% bigger than the input frames. If you
have large offsets between frames, the final image will grow
similarly.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Shift and Add8">4.9. How are edge effects taken into account?</a></b></dt>
<dd>Pixels located on the edges of the final stacked image are by
definition inconsistent with pixels located in the center, because
they have seen less signal. To cope with this inconsistency, there are
two methods:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Divide the final frame by the total number of input
	frames.</li>
	<li>Divide each pixel in the final frame by the number of
	contributing pixels.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first method maintains a consistent signal-to-noise ratio over the
frame, the second one maintains a consistent photometry for objects
located on the edges. Version 3 and earlier of eclipse offered only
the first method. Version 4 currently only offers the second method,
an option might be added later on if the need arises.<br><br></dd>

<hr><h2>5. Software-related questions</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b><a name="Software-related questions0">5.1. jitter uses more RAM than I have!</a></b></dt>
<dd>Since version 3.0, <b>eclipse</b> uses a new (hopefully portable)
memory allocation scheme. Without going into too many details, the
library opens its own swap files in a temporary directory and tells
the Operating System to use it as virtual memory.
<p>
Some process monitoring tools such as <tt>top</tt> will report these
temporary files (of litterally unlimited size) as memory use, thus
providing a false information. Do not be alarmed by the quantities
announced on <tt>top</tt> on systems such as Solaris and Linux, they
are just bugged. <i>jitter</i> has been reported to show a memory use
of more than 2 gigabytes (on a 32-bit system!) with no more than half a gig
of memory space (RAM chips + swap space)... Do not always believe blindly
your memory monitoring tools.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Software-related questions1">5.2. Is there a way to save intermediate data in case of machine crashes?</a></b></dt>
<dd>No.<br><br></dd>

<hr><h2>6. Output FITS file format</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b><a name="Output FITS file format0">6.1. What is the meaning of the <tt>EXPTIME</tt> keyword?</a></b></dt>
<dd>According to the dictionary definition for ESO keywords:
<p>
<i>
EXPTIME provides the total integration time in seconds; it may have
decimals. When the exposure is made of several periods, EXPTIME time is
the sum of the exposure periods, and not simply the difference between
end and start of exposure. Subintegrations, i.e. multiple exposures
before a readout of the detector are described by the DIT and NDIT.
</i>
<p>
The reference is <a href="http://archive.eso.org/dicb/">
The Data Interface Control Board document</a>.
<p>
This being said, the EXPTIME written in the output header by 'jitter' is
the EXPTIME found in the first input header (<b>NOT</b> the sum of all
EXPTIME values from all input files). This has been done upon
request from the instrument scientist.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b><a name="Output FITS file format1">6.2. What are these <tt>HIERARCH ESO PRO</tt> keywords?</a></b></dt>
<dd>They are added to identify the frame as a pipeline product, in the ESO
DataFlow environment. The only keywords you might be interested in are:
<p>
<pre>

PRO DATE         date the jitter process was executed
PRO DATANCOM     how many frames were combined to produce this one
