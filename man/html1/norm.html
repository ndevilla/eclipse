Name
       norm - normalize a cube/image

Synopsis
       norm [options] &lt;incube&gt; [outcube]

Description
       norm is used to normalize a cube with respect to a unity pixel scale, a
       unity mean pixel value, a unity flux, or a unity absolute  flux.   norm
       can also scale all fluxes in a cube to a given value (see -f option) or
       to the flux of the first plane in the cube.

Algorithm
       norm supports several normalization schemes. See options.

       For a cube, the normalization is applied to each plane independently.

       default output name for in.fits is in.norm.fits

Options
       -m  scale
              normalizes pixel values so that the minimum value is 0.0 and the
              maximum  is  1.0. All other pixel values are scaled accordingly.
              No use is made of the BSCALE and BZERO FITS keywords  for  this!
              This  means  that some pixel depth resolution is usually lost in
              this operation.

       -m  mean
              normalizes pixel values so that the mean pixel value is 1.0.

       -m  flux
              normalizes the image to a unity flux, i.e. divide the  image  by
              the sum of all pixel values.

       -m  aflux
              normalizes  the image to an absolute unity flux, i.e. divide the
              image by the sum of all absolute pixel values.

       -m  scaleflux
              used with the -f option, this mode scales all  plane  fluxes  to
              the  parameter given with the -f option. Without this parameter,
              all plane fluxes are scaled according to the flux in  the  first
              plane of the input cube.

       -f  reqFlux
              to be used with the "scaleflux" mode only. This parameter speci-
              fies to which flux value all planes fluxes have to be  rescaled.

Files
       Input files shall all comply with FITS format.
