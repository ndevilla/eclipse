       peak - peak measurements

Synopsis
       peak [options] image.fits

Description
       peak detects localizes bright object centroids in an image. It takes as
       argument a list of FITS cube names and outputs on stdout the center  of
       each detected bright zone, an estimation of FWHM in x and y, an average
       FWHM, a flux estimation, and  the  minimum  and  maximum  pixel  values
       around each object.

       Two  different  detection method can be used with the peak command: the
       ’kappa-sigma’ method (default) or the  ’squares’  method  (use  the  -m
       (--method) option to choose).

       With  the ’kappa-sigma’ method, bright objects are detected if and only
       if they contain a peak of sufficient amplitude i.e. more than K  devia-
       tions  above  the  median  image  value, AND if they cover a surface at
       least of 3x3 pixels.  To detect peaks located in a window smaller  than
       3x3,  there  is  an  option to smear out the image by a low-pass filter
       before applying peak detection, but of course it has  associated  draw-
       backs.   By  default,  peak  will be looking at all the signal which is
       more than 2 deviations above the median pixel value. This value can  be
       changed using the -k (or --kappa) option.  Notice that this is not more
       than kappa-sigma clipping for signal detection, except  that  to  avoid
       mis-estimation  of  the  mean and sigma in crowded fields, the measure-
       ments are done with the median and a deviation  which  is  the  average
       absolute distance to the median.

       In  the  ’square’  method,  a standard deviation filter is apply to the
       image, which has the effect to  make  the  bright  points  appear  like
       squares. This squares image is then used as a mask to detect objects.

       In spite of calls to morphological filters, peak is surprisingly faster
       than other usual algorithms. It should be used as a peak position esti-
       mator more than a precise locator, though.

Algorithms
       Kappa-sigma method

       If  smearing  is  activated, the input image is smeared out with a low-
       pass 5x5 filter before detection is applied. This filtered  version  of
       the  input  image  is only used for detection purposes, and not for any
       kind of later measurement.

       A binary map is first created of all pixel positions which have a value
       above a given threshold (by default, median plus 2 deviations).

       A  binary  morphological  erosion, and a dilation are then performed on
       the binary map to close all regions smaller than 3x3, which removes all
       isolated  bad pixels. If smearing was applied, small objects would have
       been enlarged to bigger than 3x3 and appear in the resulting pixel map.

       A  floodfill  algorithm  is applied to find the geometric center of all
       white blobs, weighted by pixel values taken from the original image.

       Squares method

       A standard deviation filter is applied to  the  image  which  make  the
       bright  objects  appaear like bright squares. This bright squares image
       is then binarized and used as  a  mask  to  identify  zones  where  the
       objects  are  in  the  original  image. A morphological closing is then
       applied, and the remaining objects are registered.

       For both methods, if fine positioning is  activated  (-f  or  --finepos
       option),  a subsequent process is called, which requests 3 user-defined
       radiuses in pixels: r1, r2, and r3. For each found peak position in the
       image,  a  background is computed as the median pixel value in the ring
       centered on the estimated peak position, of radiuses r2 and r3. Then  a
       barycenter  is  computed  within the disk centered on the same spot, of
       radius r1, using background-subtracted pixel values  as  weights.  This
       fine  positioning  method proves quite reliable, but requires all peaks
       in the image to have more or less the same size to fit into the circles
       defined by r1, r2, r3.

Options
       -m clip or --method clip
              Use ’kappa-sigma’ detection method.

       -m squares or --method squares
              Use ’squares’ detection method.

       -k cut or --kappa cut
              To  be used for ’kappa-sigma’ method.  Use this option to change
              the cut level in a factor of deviations. The lower  this  value,
              the  more  bright  zones may be detected. The higher this factor
              is, the less detected peaks. The default of 2.0  seems  to  work
              fine on images having a high Signal to Noise Ratios.

       -s  or  --smear
              This  option  (low-pass filter) applies a 5x5 convolution with a
              flat kernel before trying to detect  objects.  The  smearing  is
              h.PPful  to  detect objects which are smaller than a 3x3 window.
              It increases the number of detections, but also  the  number  of
              false  detections. Bad pixels, for example, are smeared out to a
              5x5 window and detected as proper peaks. Another issue is that 2
              close  peaks will be smeared out to a single one. Most probably,
              the returned result will  be  a  barycenter  of  the  2  regions
              instead  of  the  2  expected centers. Because the smearing will
              lower the signal in all regions, the default sigma cut is halved
              when this options is used.

       -S or --sqhsize ’hx hy’
              To  be  used for ’squares’ method.  Define the size of the stan-
              dard deviation filter applied to generate the squares image. The
              bigger the filter is, the bigger the squares are.

       -f ’r1 r2 r3’ or --fpos ’r1 r2 r3’
              Fine  positioning:  provide  three  values  r1  &lt;  r2 &lt; r3.  The
              radiuses r2 and r3 specify a ring around  each  detected  point,
              from  which  an  estimation  of  the  background is computed.  A
              barycenter is then computed in the  disk  of  radius  r1,  using
              background-subtracted  pixel  values as weights. No defaults are
              given to these parameters.
              Be aware when using this position refining that it  assumes  the
              following conditions.

       All  peaks  are  isolated, i.e. the closest distance between 2 peaks is
       strictly greater than 2 * r3.

       There is a background zone around every peak, always  within  the  disk
       defined  by r2 and r3. Otherwise, the background estimation is contami-
       nated with peak signals.

       All peaks are contained in a disk of radius r1.

       -F or --fwhm
              Flag to print out the fhwm for detected objects.

       -P or --phot ’r1 r2 r3’
              Provides the radiuses used to compute photometry.

       -d or --rtd
              Flag to display detected objects in rtd.

Bugs
       Peaks located on an image edge will not be detected.
