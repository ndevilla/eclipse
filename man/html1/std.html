Name
       std - standard star search

Synopsis
       std [search] [display]

Description
       std  is a command-line tool which allows to browse an internal database
       of infra-red standard stars.  std contains  internally  a  database  of
       more  than  800  stars,  built-up by J.G.Cuby.  From the catalog, it is
       possible to select stars based  on  a  position  criterion,  name,  sky
       region, or magnitude in a given band.  Results can be displayed in dif-
       ferent formats.

Search Options
       Search options are related to different user-defined criteria to select
       a number of stars in the database. The following are implemented:

       -p/--pos HH MM SS HH MM SSorDD DD
              If  this  is the only search criterion on the command-line, only
              the closest star to this position will be returned. The position
              can  be  provided  as  hours, minutes, seconds for RA and DEC (6
              values expected) or simply in degrees (2 values expected).

       -r/--radius value
              Together with the --pos option, this specifies a radius around a
              sky position. All stars within this region will be selected.

       -n/--name value
              To search stars by name. The provided value is a regular expres-
              sion, all stars matching it will be selected.

       -m/--mag band min max
              To search stars by magnitude range in a given  wave  band.  Sup-
              ported  wave bands are: J, H, K, Ks, L, Lprime, M, Mprime. Mini-
              mum and maximum magnitudes define a range into which  all  stars
              are selected.

Display Options
       -k/--key
              To display the output in keyword format.

Files
       The  star  database contains the following informations about stars (in
       this order):
       Name of the star
       RA and DEC in HH:MM:SS format
       Spectral type
       Magnitudes in J, H, K, Ks, L, M.

Examples
       To print out the closest star from position ’10 12’ (in degrees):
       std --pos "10 12"

       To print out all stars within 10 degrees of this position:
       std --pos "10 12" --radius 10

       To print out all stars which name matches "FS*"
       std --name "FS*"

       To look for all stars in band L having a magnitude between 5 and 6:
       std --mag "L 5 6"

Bugs
       It is not yet possible to combine selection criteria.
