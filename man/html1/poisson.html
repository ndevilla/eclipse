Name
       poisson - random 2d poisson point generator

Synopsis
       poisson [options]

Description
       poisson  generates  random points on a 2d plane with a Poisson law dis-
       tribution.  The idea is to generate random points with  an  homogeneous
       distribution  within the rectangle. The algorithm is simple: points are
       generated randomly within the given limits, points are rejected if they
       are  too  close  to  any previously generated point. Once the requested
       number of points has been generated, output the  point  coordinates  to
       stdout.

       The  minimum  distance between points is computed by the following for-
       mula:

       If the requested rectangle has a width of L and a height of  h,  and  n
       points are requested, we have:

       dmin = sqrt(L*h / 2*n)

       The  defaults  are the following : rectangle is located between -75 and
       +75 in x and y, points are generated with  integer  coordinate  values,
       and 20 points will be generated.

Options
       -r xmin xmax ymin ymax
              Defines  the rectangle in which points will be generated. Ranges
              may be given as integer or floating-point values.

       -f     Generate floating-point valued coordinates (default is integer).

       -n     Change the number of points to generate. Default is 20.

       -h hom Used to specify an homogeneity factor

Bugs
       This  is  the  simplest possible implementation of a Poisson generator.
       As a result, trying to generate a high number  of  points  (&gt;500)  will
       require  a very intensive random point generation before having all the
       requested points. Another approach would be to generate  random  points
       only within an allowed surface, but this is far from trivial.
