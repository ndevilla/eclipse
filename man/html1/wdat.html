Name
       wdat - read DAT tapes in Adonis format

Synopsis
       wdat [-d device] [-h] [-nr] [-l]
            [-l= file] [-fits] [-log]
            [-e= file] [-e MASK] [-s= file]
            [-s= MASK] [-q]

Description
       wdat  reads  DAT tapes written in Adonis format. The Unix tar format is
       almost universal, but is not that convenient. It is especially delicate
       to get anything out of a tape which had a problem. To prevent this, the
       Adonis format uses separate files for each data cube. In case  of  tape
       damage,  it  is most likely that just one file would be lost instead of
       all files after the damaged location. Another nice thing is that  files
       can be read on the fly and thus deliver information to the user as soon
       as it is read.

       wdat accepts many options on command-line. Use them to  indicate  which
       device you read the tape from, which files you want to include/exclude,
       if you only want to get a list of files, if you  want  to  be  notified
       before downloading a file, etc. Check below.

Options
       -d device
              where device is the Unix name of the DAT reader on your machine.
              It is most often something like /dev/nrst0 or the like.  Default
              value is the content of the TAPE environment variable.

       -h     Gives help about wdat

       -nr    Does not rewind the tape before first access.

       -l     list option, only lists DAT contents on terminal.

       -l= listfile
              list option, only lists DAT contents to file ’listfile’.

       -fits  Skips files if they are not FITS files.

       -log   Automatically translates logfiles (.LOG) from OS-9.

       -e= exfile
              exclude  option,  will  exclude from downloading all files which
              name has been matched in exfile.

       -e MASK
              will exclude all files matching the mask. A  mask  is  a  simple
              character  string, all file names containing this string will be
              excluded.

       -s= selfile
              select option, will select for downloading all files which  name
              has been matched in selfile.

       -s MASK
              will  load all files matching the mask. A mask is a simple char-
              acter string, only file names containing  this  string  will  be
              loaded.

       -q     query option, will request user confirmation before any download
              of a file.

Files
       Selected/excluded files are simple plain ASCII  files  containing  file
       names  you  want  to  select/exclude in the following format: names are
       written plainly in ASCII, and are separated by carriage returns  (other
       normal separators would work as well).

Example
       First,  get  the  list  of  all  files  on the tape from a device named
       /dev/nrst0:
       wdat -d /dev/nrst0 -l= mylistfile
       Then edit the file to download only the files you  wish  to,  with  any
       text  editor.  Extra white spaces are not important. The selection file
       shall look like:

       ADONISFILE_0001.FITS
       ADONISFILE_0002.FITS
       ...

       Then, to download only these:
       wdat -d /dev/nrst0 -s= mylistfile
