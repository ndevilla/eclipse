Name
       speedtest - CPU test for image processing

Synopsis
       speedtest

Description
       speedtest  performs  several classical image processing operations, and
       reports the time spent on CPU. The following tests are applied:

       uniformly distributed noise generation
       filtering by 3x3 kernel convolution
       filtering by 5x5 kernel convolution
       median filtering with 3x3 kernel
       statistics computation
       fast fourier transform
       resampling by a zoom factor of 2.0

       speedtest starts by generating an image containing noise only, and then
       performs  all the above operations on this image, and outputs CPU times
       for each test. CPU times are given for the total time  in  seconds  and
       the  average  per  pixel  time in microseconds. The total and per pixel
       time are given for all the tests.

       Notice that the given time values are only estimations, since they  are
       based  on  wall  clock  time,  not  on CPU time. Your results will vary
       depending on the machine workload.
