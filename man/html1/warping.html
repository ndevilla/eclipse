Name
       warping - resample a frame according to a geometrical transformation

Synopsis
       warping [parameters] [options] &lt;in&gt; [out]

Description
       warping  is  used  to  resample images according to a given geometrical
       transformation. Supported transformations for the moment are:

       Integer
       Integer transformations account for translations with  integer  offsets
       and rotations of multiples of 90 degrees. No resampling is performed in
       these cases, only pixel shifts. Integer transformations are declared on
       the  command-line  exactly  as linear transformations. The command will
       decide to go to integer pixel shifts  if  it  notices  that  the  input
       parameters are actually integer.

       Linear
       Linear  transforms  are covering translations, rotations, scale changes
       (zoom). It is also possible to provide your own expression of a  linear
       transform  as two linear polynomials of x and y. Notice that the trans-
       form is then direct: it transforms pixels from the original image  into
       pixels in the warped image.

       Polynomial
       General  polynomial transformations are of any degree in x and y.  Pro-
       vide on the command-line the degrees for x, y, and the associated coef-
       ficient.  It  is  possible to specify only a x or y transformation. The
       other direction transformation will then be Id.  Notice that the trans-
       form is then reversed (opposite of linear): it transforms pixels in the
       warped image back into pixels in the original image.
       If you are trying to fit detector distorsions, it is usually enough  to
       use  low-order  polynomials  (up  to 3rd degree), because higher orders
       would introduce oscillations, producing  undesirable  rippling  in  the
       warped  image. See the adequate litterature about detector distorsions.
       For distortion corrections, it is possible to use in option  the  TFITS
       files  produced  by  the  ISAAC  calibration  recipes  ’isaacp arc’ and
       ’isaacp startrace’ and that contain the distortion polynomials.

       Resampling is done with kernel-based  interpolations.  Several  kernels
       are  offered:  sinc,  square sinc, Lanczos2, Hamming, Hann, and tanh (a
       hyperbolic tangent based window). The default kernel is tanh,  see  the
       adequate  litterature  about  interpolation  kernels to learn more. The
       command has an option that only "shows" the kernels it  has  available,
       producing the interpolation window on stdout. By re-directing this out-
       put to a text file, it should be easy to visualize them with any  plot-
       ting tool such as gnuplot.

Parameters
       Linear transforms (includes integer transforms)

       -t or --translate tx ty
              provides  tx and ty for a translation vector. This option can be
              combined with a rotation (-r) and/or a scaling (-s) option.

       -r or --rotate angle
              provides an angle for the rotation, in degrees. Negative  angles
              are accepted. The rotation center is the center of the image.

       -s or --scale factor
              provides  a  scaling  factor.  This factor needs not be integer,
              i.e. a scaling by a factor 1.4142 is possible.

       -T or --transform ’p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6’
              If you know the expression of a linear transform to  apply,  you
              can  provide  it  through  this  option.  Provide  6  parameters
              p1...p6.  Enclose the parameters in  simple  quotes.   They  are
              defined  as  a  forward affine transform from the input image to
              the output image. If (x,y) are coordinates in  the  input  image
              and (u,v) coordinates in the output image, then:
              u = p1.x + p2.y + p3
              v = p4.x + p5.y + p6

       For  example,  to  apply a scale change of a factor 2 and a translation
       vector of (+100,-50), both commands are equivalent:

       &gt; warping -s 2 -t ’100 -50’ image.fits
       &gt; warping -T ’2 0 100 0 2 -50’ image.fits
       Providing a linear transform allows also other image deformations  than
       just rotation, scale and translation.

       Polynomial transforms

       Polynomial transforms need be expressed in a reversed way: if (u,v) are
       the coordinates of a pixel in the warped image, and (x,y) in the origi-
       nal image, the polynomial needs to be expressed as:
       x = Px(u,v)
       y = Py(u,v)
       Provide  the  two polynomial expressions through the -u and -v options.
       The polynomial format on the command-line is the following:

       A polynomial is given by triplets of values. The first value  indicates
       the  degree for u, the second one the degree for v, and the third value
       is the multiplicative coefficient. For example, 3.u^2.v is written as:
       2 1 3
       Another example: the polynomial is 3 + 4.u^2 + v
       The expression is:
       0 0 3 2 0 4 0 1 1

       -u or --polyu du dv c0 ... du dv cn
              Provides the coefficients for Px(u,v).

       -v or --polyv du dv c0 ... du dv cn
              Provides the coefficients for Py(u,v)

       -A or --arcfile file.tfits
              The specified file is a table with the 2d  polynomial  that  was
              created  by  is_spec_arc  and  that describes the slit curvature
              distortion

       -S or --sttrfile file.tfits
              The specified file is a table with the 2d  polynomial  that  was
              created  by  is_spec_startrace  and that describes the startrace
              distortion

       Resampling kernels

       -k or --kernel name
              Choose the interpolation kernel used to resample the image. Pos-
              sible choices are:

       sinc      - "ideal" filter (for infinite signals)
       sinc2     - square sinc
       lanczos   - Lanczos function (2nd order)
       hamming   - Hamming function
       hann      - Hann function
       tanh      - Hyperbolic tangent
       default   - default is tanh kernel

       If you do not know what these functions refer to, it is recommended not
       to modify them. See documentation about image  warping  to  learn  more
       about these kernels.

       -w or --write
              This  option  will  have  a kernel generated then printed out to
              stdout. No further processing will be done. The output data  can
              be  redirected  to  a  file,  and/or plotted by any graphical 2d
              plotter (e.g. gnuplot).
              Example:
              &gt; warping -k hamming -w &gt; hamming.dat

       --sub  Flag to simply perform a subsampling of the input image

Algorithm
       Resampling is done by applying a resampling kernel in image space, over
       the 16 closest neighbors. The algorithm is the following:

       For each pixel position in the resulting image, compute the position of
       the source pixel in the original image, interpolate its value over  the
       16  closest  neighbors  with the chosen kernel. Pixel positions falling
       out of the original image are assigned a null value.

Files
       Input files shall all comply with FITS format.

Bugs
       The interpolation over 16 neighbors implies border  effects  which  are
       not  handled. Interpolation artifacts can be seen close to high spatial
       frequencies (especially on bad pixels).

       Only images shall be warped, not data  cubes.  This  extension  may  be
       implemented in a future release.

       In  linear  transforms: applying only a rotation turns the image around
       its center. If you try to combine a rotation and a scaling or a  trans-
       lation,  rotation  is  then done relative to the pixel (0,0), i.e.  the
       lower left pixel of the image.

       Radial transforms are not implemented yet.
