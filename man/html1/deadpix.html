Name
       deadpix - bad pixel map handling

Synopsis
       deadpix [parameters]

Description
       deadpix  is  a  tool  to generate bad pixel maps from images of the sky
       background in infrared. It can also be used to remove bad pixel contri-
       butions in a frame by applying a bad pixel map on it.

       Methods  offered  by this tool for bad pixel detection are not the best
       ones, statistical studies of a twilight data set usually brings a  more
       reliable  information  about pixel quality (see flat command). However,
       these methods are still of some use when no other  data  are  available
       for calibration.

       The  skyvar method needs a sky cube, preferrably with many planes (&gt;20)
       to observe meaningful statistical behaviours.

       The median method detects spikes in an image, it needs in input a small
       number (&lt;10) of flat frames.

       The  cleaning  algorithm  only requires a valid pixel map and a cube to
       clean out.

Detection Algorithms
       Two methods are implemented for bad pixel detection. They both make use
       of sky images.

       First method : sky variations statistics (skyvar method)

       Letâ€™s  compute for each pixel its standard deviation along time.  If we
       plot a histogram of these standard deviations, we see a gaussian-shaped
       function  that  represents the response to the sky signal. We decide to
       throw away all pixels which response is too  low  (dead)  or  too  high
       (noisy)  by  rejecting  all  pixels  out of a central +/- sigma_width/2
       interval on the histogram.  Default sigma_width is 3, it can be changed
       by feeding a new sigma width through the -s option.

       example:
       &gt; deadpix -d --skyvar --sigma 4 --sky skycube.fits

       Second method : median filter detection (median method)

       This  method  does  not  make  use  of  temporal information, by merely
       observes each image independently. If we  assume  that  the  signal  is
       smooth enough, bad pixels are spikes easily found by computing the dif-
       ference between the image and its median filtered version, and  thresh-
       olding it. All spikes are then detected. This is not as strong as using
       the temporal information, but this is the  only  way  when  not  enough
       images  are  present.   Default  threshold  is fixed to 10.0, it can be
       changed by using the -m option. This threshold  is  given  directly  in
       pixel values.

       example:
       &gt; deadpix -d --median --threshold 15 --sky skyplanes.fits

Cleaning Algorithm
       The  algorithm  used to clean out a plane from bad pixels is simple. It
       just replaces bad pixel positions by an average of the valid pixels out
       of the 8 closest neighbours. If no value is available, the pixel is set
       to null.

       example:
       &gt; deadpix --clean --in toclean.fits --pixmap badpixmap

Parameters
       First, choose between dead pixel  detection  and  dead  pixel  cleaning
       mode.  This is done by activating either --detect/-d or --clean/-c com-
       mand-line options.

       Detection mode: --detect or -d

       --skyvar or -m skyvar
              This forces the use of the sky variation method  for  bad  pixel
              detection.  An expected parameter is then --sigma.

       --sigma value or -s value
              This specifies the sigma threshold for the sky variation method.
              Default value is 3.0.

       --median or -m median
              This forces the use of the median method for  bad  pixel  detec-
              tion. An expected parameter is then --threshold.

       --threshold thr or -t thr
              This  specifies  the  median  threshold  for  the median method.
              Default value is thr=10.

       --sky name or -S name
              Specifies the name of the file which contains the sky planes  to
              work with. This is used by both detection methods.

       Cleaning mode: --clean or -c

       --in name or -i name
              Specifies the name of the input file to clean out.

       --out name or -o name
              Specifies  the  name  of  the  output  file  to  create. This is
              optional, default naming scheme for input files named *.fits  is
              *.cln.fits.

       Parameters common to both modes

       --pixmap name or -p name
              This  specifies the name of a pixel map. In detection mode, this
              is an output since the goal of the detection is to produce a bad
              pixel  map.  In cleaning mode, this is an input which is used to
              clean out other files.

Files
       Input files shall all comply with FITS format.  Pixel maps are in 8 bit
       FITS format.

       In  a bad pixel map, good pixels are set to 1, bad pixels are set to 0.
       This can also be found in bad pixel map FITS headers, where the follow-
       ing keywords are written:

       GOODPIX = 1
       BADPIX  = 0

Notice
       Pixel  maps are in 8 bits signed FITS format. They can be easily viewed
       that way.
