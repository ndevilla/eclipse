Name
       stcube - cube statistics

Synopsis
       stcube [options] &lt;cubes...&gt;

Description
       stcube gives basic statistics about each plane in a cube. It is used to
       have a quick look at what kind of data is in the cube.

       The display looks like :

       #--------------------------------------------------
       # FILE stdstar_check.fits
       # PLANE  MIN   MAX      MEAN      MEDIAN    STDEV
         0001   -287  9709.33  15.0937   0.833328  228.504
       #--------------------------------------------------

       For each plane:

       MIN is the minimum value.

       MAX is the maximum value.

       MEAN is the average pixel value.

       MEDIAN is the median pixel value.

       STDEV is the standard deviation.

       There is one display for each FITS file given on command line.   stcube
       accepts jokers on command line :
       &gt; stcube *.fits

Options
       -b or --badpixmap filename
              give a bad pixel map to take into account when computing statis-
              tics on the cube.

       -z or --zone ’llx lly urx ury’
              To compute statistics only on a rectangular zone in the  images.
              The  zone  is  specified  by  indicating  the coordinates of the
              lower-left and upper-right corners of the rectangle. Borders are
              inclusive.   The  coordinate  system  is  the  one used by FITS,
              namely that the lower left pixel in the image is labelled (1,1),
              x-axis  increasing  from  left  to right, y-axis increasing from
              bottom to top.

       -s or --stdev &lt;name&gt;
              To compute a standard deviation frame (only), with name  &lt;name&gt;.
              This  mode  of  stcube  accepts  only one input file name, which
              should correspond to the name of a 3d FITS file or a valid ASCII
              list (i.e. a data cube). The input cube is processed to obtain a
              frame that is giving the standard deviation of all pixels  along
              time.  If  several  input names are provided, only the first one
              will be taken into account.

Examples
       To compute the standard deviation frame named ’stdev.fits’ from a  cube
       named ’cube.fits’, you would use:
       &gt; stcube --stdev stdev.fits cube.fits

       To  compute  statistics  on  the  lower left quadrant only of a 256x256
       image, you would use:
       &gt; stcube --zone ’1 1 128 128’ image.fits
