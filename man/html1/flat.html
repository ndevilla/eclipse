Name
       flat - create linear gain maps out of twilight data cubes

Synopsis
       flat [flags] &lt;twilight&gt; [basename]

Description
       flat  is used to process twilight data cubes to create linear gain maps
       and  bad  pixel  maps.  Twilight  data  cubes  are  a  slowly  increas-
       ing/decreasing  signal that may be used to record pixelsâ€™ responses. In
       this way, it is mainly possible to  see  which  pixels  have  a  linear
       response,  in  which  domain,  and  if the response is linear, a simple
       regression gives the pixel gain, relative to the mean (or median) gain.

Algorithm
       flat  makes  a computation of linear regression factors on every pixel,
       outputting the value of the fitted slope.  The  overall  luminosity  in
       each  image is approximated by the median flux. This assumes a majority
       of pixels are valid, a valid assumption for standard detectors.

       A rejection is applied on the time line to avoid taking  into  accounts
       stellar  objects  which  are  seen  in twilight frames. This is done by
       applying a robust linear fit.
       Byproducts of this computation are the y-intercept map, an error map, a
       bad  pixel  map.  So far, the only used criterion to declare a pixel as
       bad is to tag all pixels outside a [0.5, 2.0] gain interval as invalid.
       Some  more  criteria  could  be derived from a close study of the slope
       fit.

       Output file names are all named according to a base name. The gain  map
       is called base_flat.fits, the intercept map is base_intercept.fits, the
       error map is base_errmap.fits, the bad pixel map  is  base_badpix.fits.
       The  base name is either given on the command-line after the input file
       name, or it can be omitted on the command-line. In that case, the input
       file base name (i.e. without .FITS or .fits extension) will be used.

       A  proportional  fit  (y=ax)  can  be requested instead of a full slope
       (y=ax+b), in which case no intercept map can be produced.  The  propor-
       tional  fit  will  compute  every  possible value of y/x, then take the
       median one. This has been found to be quite robust.

       If you provide a dark frame to subtract from all input twilight frames,
       the proportional fit mode will be activated automatically.

Options
       -o or --intercepts
              Output  a y-intercepts map. This is a byproduct of the slope fit
              (see above).

       -e or --errmap
              Output an error map from the linear fit. This image contains for
              each  pixel  the  residual  sum of squared errors for all fitted
              points.

       -b or --pixmap
              Output a bad pixel map. This is a byproduct of the gain map. All
              pixels  outside  of  a fixed [0.5, 2.0] (inclusive) interval are
              tagged as bad.  The output is a pixel map (i.e. a FITS file). If
              you  are not satisfied with these threshold settings, use thresh
              to set other thresholds on the gain map.

       -p or --prop
              Instead of trying to fit a full slope (y=ax+b), only  a  propor-
              tional  slope  (y=ax)  will  be  fitted.  This  option  will  be
              activated when dark subtraction is requested.

       -d filename or --dark filename
              Provide a dark frame to subtract from all input twilight frames.
              Check  that  the  dark  frame you provide uses the same exposure
              time as the twilight frames. Proportional fit  is  activated  in
              that case.

Files
       Input files shall all comply with FITS format.
