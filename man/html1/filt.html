Name
       filt - apply a digital filter in spatial domain

Synopsis
       filt [parameters] &lt;in&gt; [out]

Description
       filt  is  a  cube filter in image domain. Choose the kind of filter you
       want to apply, the resulting cube will be a filtered (plane  by  plane)
       version of the input cube.

Parameters
       -f name or --filter name
              Choose  the filter to apply. Supported filters are: user-linear,
              dx, dy, d2x, d2y, contour1, contour2, contour3, contrast1,  min,
              max,  median,  max-min,  user-morpho.   Find  their descriptions
              below.

       -p ’f1 ... f9’or --val ’f1 ... f9’
              To be used with filters ’user-linear’ or ’user-morpho’, to  pro-
              vide  9  values  to  define  the  filter. All 9 values are given
              enclosed in single quotes, separated by one or more blank  char-
              acters.

       -k hsor --khsize hs
              To be used only with the flat filter. hs is the half-size of the
              kernel (1 for a 3x3 kernel, 2 for a 5x5, ...).

Algorithm
       In image processing, there are numerous ways to filter an  image.  This
       collection  of filters all remain in the spatial domain. The basic idea
       is to convolve the image with a 3x3 or 5x5 kernel. For bigger  kernels,
       it is often less time-consuming to go to Fourier space with an FFT.
       If we describe a 3x3 neighborhood as :

       pix1 pix2 pix3
       pix4 pix5 pix6
       pix7 pix8 pix9

       The  new pixel will be a linear combination of pix1 to pix9. The combi-
       nation is then normalized by dividing by the sum  of  all  coeficients,
       except for NULL sums where no normalization is applied.

       new = a1.pix1 + a2.pix2 + ... + a9.pix9
       (’.’ denoting multiplication).

       An example is a low-pass filter defined by the set of 9 coefficients :

       1 1 1
       1 1 1
       1 1 1

       The derivative in x axis can be computed by applying :

       -1   0    1
       -1   0    1
       -1   0    1

       And  so  on.  See image processing books for more details about digital
       filtering in spatial domain !  If you choose a user-defined filter, you
       get prompted for 9 values, that are the coefficients described above.

       For  morphological filters, the idea remains the same, except that pix1
       to pix9 are sorted before combination, that is :

       new = a1.min(pix1, .., pix9) + ... + a9.max(pix1, ..., pix9)

       The well-known median filter is then simply described  by  the  coeffi-
       cients :
       0  0  0   0  1  0   0  0  0
       That  is,  each  pixel is replaced by the median value of its neighbor-
       hood.  Due to this necessary sorting on every pixel, morphological fil-
       ters are usually very computer-intensive.

       user-morpho
              Provide  9 values for a 3x3 morphological filter, through the -p
              or --val option.

       flat   This filter applies an NxN convolution with a matrix filled with
              ones  only.  This is a low-pass filter. The size of the convolu-
              tion kernel to use can be set through the -k or --khsize option.
              Example:  calling a flat filter with the option -k 2 will filter
              the image with a 5x5 kernel containing only ones everywhere. The
              computation time increases tremendously with the kernel size, it
              is not recommended to use too large kernels.

Files
       Input files shall all comply with FITS format.

       The original FITS header  of the input FITS file  is  conserved  along,
       except  for  the  following  keywords:  NAXIS,  NAXISn, BITPIX, BSCALE,
       BZERO, which are related to the newly created file.

       HISTORY keywords are appended  to  the  FITS  header  to  indicate  the
       eclipse process modifications.

       The output file naming scheme is: *.fits becomes *.filter.fits.

Examples
       To apply an x derivative to a file named ’in.fits’, do:
       filt --filter dx in.fits
       the created output file is named ’in.dx.fits’.

       To apply a median filter to a file named ’m51.fits’, do:
       filt --filter median m51.fits
       the created output file is named ’m51.median.fits’/

       To apply a user-defined morphological filter to ’sofi.fits’:
       filt --filter user-morpho --val ’1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1’ sofi.fits

       To  apply  a  flat  low-pass filter with a 21x21 kernel to a file named
       ’m51.fits’, do:
       filt --filter flat --khsize 10 m51.fits
