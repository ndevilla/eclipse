Name
       fft - fft 2d on an image

Synopsis
       fft [options] &lt;in&gt; &lt;out&gt;

Description
       fft  computes a Fast Fourier Transform on an input image.  fft can also
       compute an inverse FFT. Results can have swapped quadrants, and can  be
       expressed in polar or cartesian coordinates.

       Take  care  about  the formats : polar/cartesian and swapped/unswapped.
       The default procedure is:

       In input of a forward FFT, an image is required. It  is  taken  as  the
       real part (in cartesian coordinates) of a complex 2d signal which imag-
       inary part is set to zeros. The output of a forward FFT is a complex 2d
       signal,  i.e.  2  image  planes. By default, the output is converted to
       polar coordinates (modulus, phase), and then quadrants are  swapped  in
       both  modulus  and  phase  to  put low frequencies at the center of the
       images.  To prevent this default behaviour, use the -n and  -c  options
       described below.

       In  input of an inverse FFT, a cube containing 2 images is required. It
       is taken as a complex 2d signal which first plane contains the  modulus
       and  second  plane  contains  the phase. Before the inverse FFT is com-
       puted, a swapping of quadrants occurs, and then a conversion to  carte-
       sian  (real,  imaginary)  coordinates is performed. To prevent quadrant
       swapping or cartesian conversion, use the -n and -c  options  described
       below.

       The output of an inverse FFT is a cube containing 2 images in cartesian
       unswapped format, first one being the real part, second one  being  the
       imaginary part (meaningless imagewise).

Algorithm
       fft uses the Danielson-Lanczos lemma, in a code based on one originally
       written by N. M. Brenner, described in Numerical Recipes in C.

Options
       -c  or  --noconv
              Switches to cartesian mode the following data:
              output for a forward FFT (default is polar),  or  input  for  an
              inverse FFT.

       -i  or  --inverse
              Inverse  FFT.  The  input  is a cube containing two planes only.
              Default I/O format for these 2 planes is polar coordinates (mod-
              ulus,  phase).  It  will  output  a cube containing 1 plane only
              (imaginary part is meaningless imagewise).  The  input  will  be
              swapped before FFT, unless the -n option is used.

       -n  or  --noswap
              This  option  prevents fft from swapping the output of a forward
              FFT and the input of an inverse FFT.

       -s  or  --swaponly
              This option can be used to apply the swapping and quit.

       Swapping is done according to the following rule :
       1 2
       4 3
       becomes then
       3 4
       2 1
       which puts then the lowest frequencies at the center of the image.

Files
       Input files shall all comply with FITS format.
