Name
       ado_pl - simple Adonis pipeline

Synopsis
       ado_pl [options]

Description
       ado_pl is an Adonis specific command. It handles all basics of sky-sub-
       traction, flat-field division and bad pixel correction. It needs one or
       several  data  cubes containing both sky and object planes, and option-
       ally a flat-field and a bad pixel map.  ado_pl is very specific to Ado-
       nis in the way it recognizes how data are organized in the file. It can
       be used with other data, however, provided they are separated  into  an
       object and a sky file.

       The 2 supported data formats are:

       Data  has  been acquired by offseting the telescope. Sky and object are
       provided in separated files. This is the  SEPARATED  functioning  mode,
       which  algorithm  is  described  below.  Use  the  -a and -s options to
       declare the object and sky file names.

       Chopping has been done, with whatever acquisition pattern. This is  the
       PACKED  functioning mode, algorithm described below.  Use the -p option
       to declare the packed cube name.

       If acquisition does not match any of these schemes, make the  best  use
       of extract and catcube to reformat data into an acceptable format.

       Once  the sky has been correctly subtracted, the user may want to flat-
       field the result and/or correct the bad pixels. These calibration  data
       must  have been prepared before, and are provided through the -f (flat-
       field) and -b (bad pixel map) options on command line.

       As usual, a flat-field is a linear gain map which mean value is 1.0, it
       shows  the pixel-to-pixel response of the detector.  A bad pixel map is
       in standard eclipse format: an 8-bit FITS file, with pixel value  of  1
       for good pixels and 0 for bad ones.

Algorithm
       1. SEPARATED DATA

       The algorithm is:

       * Average the sky to sky_avg
       * Subtract sky_avg from each plane in the object cube
       * Average the sky-subtracted object if requested.
       * Append results to the output cube

       2. PACKED DATA

       Data is acquired in cycles of object/sky. The algorithm is:

       * Extract every cycle in the cube. For each cycle:
       * Extract all sky planes in this cycle
       * Average the sky planes to one: sky_avg
       * Subtract sky_avg from all object planes in cycle
       * Average the resulting sky-subtracted object planes if requested
       * Append results to the output cube

       The  output will have one plane per cycle in the initial cube. No aver-
       age is made on the output, for  it  may  need  some  shift-and-add,  or
       selection,  or  wiser  averaging.  Make  use  of other eclipse tools to
       reduce this cube to one image.

Options
       -p  filename
              to declare a packed cube name, in PACKED data mode only.

       -a  filename
              to declare an object filename, in SEPARATED data mode only.

       -s  filename
              to declare a sky filename, in SEPARATED data mode only.

       -o  filename
              to declare an output filename, any mode. Default is  calib.fits.

       -f  filename
              to  declare  a  flat-field  file name to use with this data. The
              output planes will all be divided by this image. PACKED or SEPA-
              RATED mode.

       -b  filename
              to  declare a bad pixel map file name to use with this data. The
              output planes will all be bad pixel  corrected  using  this  bad
              pixel  map.   The  default  behaviour  is: look for a file named
              ’badpixmap’ in current directory, which fits the  usual  eclipse
              format for pixel maps, and use it. If this file is not available
              or the -b option was not used, do not correct  for  bad  pixels.
              PACKED or SEPARATED mode.

       -1     1  (one) requests an average of object frames to a single frame.
              In the case of SEPARATED data, it is equivalent to averaging all
              object frames to a single one. In the case of PACKED data, it is
              equivalent to outputting one plane per cube cycle.

Example
       For a PACKED input cube named f0118.fits, with the following cycle key-
       words in its FITS header:
       NAXIS3 = 240
       OJ_N_SEQ = 30
       OJ_N_IMA = 4
       OB_CYCL = 01

       Requesting  a  processing with option -1 active will create one average
       object frame per cycle, i.e. 30 frames. Without this option on, it will
       create one object frame per input object frame, i.e. 120.

Files
       Input files shall all comply with FITS format.
