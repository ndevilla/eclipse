Name
       ipaste - paste an image into another

Synopsis
       ipaste [parameters] [options] frame insert [out]

Description
       ipaste  inserts  an  image  into  another  one.  insert is the image to
       insert and frame the image which receives the insertion.  Default  out-
       put name is ’pasted.fits’.

       ipaste  requires 2 coordinates in the frame image referential, indicat-
       ing the point where the first pixel  of  the  insert  image  should  be
       pasted. The image is then inserted in its original orientation.

       If  the  inserted  image  is too big to fit on right or top side, it is
       clipped to the frame image limits ( ipaste outputs a warning).

       Default is: insert image starting from lower left corner (1,1) of frame
       image.

       Coordinates  are  referred to as in the FITS standard: lower left pixel
       is (1,1), x increasing from left to right and y increasing from  bottom
       to top.

Options
       -x xpos
              Defines  x  coordinate  lower  left  corner  of place to insert.
              Default is 1 (first column on left).

       -y ypos
              Defines y coordinate lower  left  corner  of  place  to  insert.
              Default is 1 (first line on bottom).

Example
       The frame image is frame.fits, the inserted one is pad.fits, the output
       name being defaulted. Let frame.fits be of size 400x300,  and  pad.fits
       be  20x10.  To insert pad.fits in the upper right corner of frame.fits,
       do:
       % ipaste -x 380 -y 290 frame.fits pad.fits
       The output is named pasted.fits.

       To insert pad.fits in upper left corner of frame.fits, do:
       % ipaste -x 1 -y 290 frame.fits pad.fits

       To insert in the center of the image, do:
       % ipaste -x 190 -y 145 frame.fits pad.fits

Files
       Input/output files shall all comply with FITS format.

       The original FITS header of the ’frame’ FITS file is  conserved  along,
       except  for  the  following  keywords:  NAXIS,  NAXISn, BITPIX, BSCALE,
       BZERO, which are related to the newly created file.

       HISTORY keywords are appended  to  the  FITS  header  to  indicate  the
       eclipse process modifications, together with the command line which was
       used to generate the file.
