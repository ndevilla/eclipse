Name
       average - cube averaging

Synopsis
       average [options] [parameters]

Description
       average  reduces  a FITS cube over its third dimension, by applying one
       of several possible algorithms described below. Users should specify  a
       cut  and  a  method. The cut describes how planes in the input cube are
       grouped for averaging, the method specifies what  kind  of  average  is
       applied.

Parameters
       -i &lt;incube&gt; or --in &lt;incube&gt;
              Specifies the name of the input cube (mandatory).

       -o &lt;outcube&gt; or --out &lt;outcube&gt;
              Specifies the name of the output cube (optional). Default output
              name for an input cube named incube.fits is incube.avg.fits.

Options
       Cuts

       Cuts specify how to group  the  input  planes  to  apply  the  average.
       Default cut is --cut whole.

       --cut whole
              applies the average on the whole cube, i.e. all planes are aver-
              aged to a single one according to the requested method.

       --cut cycle --step &lt;n&gt;
              applies the average for every &lt;n&gt; planes in the input cube.  For
              example,  if  the  input cube contains 50 planes and this cut is
              specified with n=10, the planes will be averaged  10  by  10  to
              produce one cube in output containing 5 planes.

       --cut running --halfwidth &lt;h&gt;
              Performs  a  running average: the output is a cube containing as
              many planes as the input cube. Each plane is the  result  of  an
              average  over  an  interval  centered  on  the same plane in the
              input, plus or minus &lt;h&gt; planes. This means that central  planes
              will  be  the average of 2h+1 input planes, and edge planes will
              be an average of between h+1 and 2h+1 input planes.

       Example: the input cube has 6 planes, h=2. Brackets show where the cen-
       tral plane is at each iteration.

       plane 1 is built from [1] 2  3
       plane 2 is built from  1 [2] 3  4
       plane 3 is built from  1  2 [3] 4  5
       plane 4 is built from     2  3 [4] 5  6
       plane 5 is built from        3  4 [5] 6
       plane 6 is built from           4  5 [6]

       Methods

       Methods specify how to perform the average. Default is linear.

       --method linear
              Performs a normal, linear average of the input planes.

       --method sum
              Same  as  linear,  but does not divide by the number of averaged
              planes at the end. Useful for cubes which do not have much  sig-
              nal.

       --method median
              Median filtering along the z-axis.

       --method filtered
              with additional parameters --filt-low npix and --filt-high npix.
              This is actually an extension of the median average. A time line
              is  extracted for each pixel position on the detector (along the
              z-axis), and then sorted out. The median average would only keep
              the  central  value,  whereas  this  method requests two numbers
              specifying how many low and high pixels shall be rejected before
              making an average.

Files
       Input files shall all comply with FITS format.

Bugs
       It  is not yet possible to combine a running filter cut with a filtered
       average method.
