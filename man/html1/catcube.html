Name
       catcube - cube/image concatenation to one cube

Synopsis
       catcube [options] [-o output] &lt;cube1&gt; [cube2] ... [cube n]

Description
       catcube  creates  an output cube that is sum on the z-axis of all other
       cubes given on command line in order of appearance from left to  right.
       e.g.
       catcube -o outcube cube.001 cube.002 image.001 cube.003
       will  create  an output cube ’outcube’ with planes consisting of planes
       cube.001 first, then planes of cube.002, then image.001, then cube.003.
       All planes shall have the same size (width, height). The pixel depth of
       the output cube is the most restrictive, i.e. the one which  needs  the
       highest amount of bits.  catcube accepts jokers on command line :
       &gt; catcube -o output.fits ADO*.fits

       The  default  output name is ’cat.fits’. The -o option may be specified
       anywhere on the command line. Example: the following lines are strictly
       equivalent:

       catcube f0001 f0002 -o output.fits f003 f004

       catcube -o output.fits f0001 f0002 f003 f004

       catcube f0001 f0002 f003 f004 -o output.fits

Files
       Input files shall all comply with FITS format Output file pixel type is
       the highest input pixel type encountered.

       The original FITS header  of the first given FITS file on command  line
       is  conserved  along, except for the following keywords: NAXIS, NAXISn,
       BITPIX, BSCALE, BZERO, which are related to the newly created file.

       HISTORY keywords are appended  to  the  FITS  header  to  indicate  the
       eclipse process modifications.
