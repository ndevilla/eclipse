Name
       ado_refits - reformat an Adonis FITS file to standard FITS

Synopsis
       ado_refits [options] &lt;FITS files...&gt;

Description
       ado_refits  is  used to ’reformat’ features in the cube header that may
       not comply 100% with the FITS standard.  If time information is present
       in the images, it is removed from the planes and written in the header.

       Output files have the same name as input files,  but  no  leading  path
       name. To overwrite files, use ado_refits in the directory where you put
       your data files.  If you do not want to overwrite your files,  go  into
       the directory where you want to put the new set of files, and fetch the
       files by giving their complete path name.

Options
       -c     Convert HIERACH keywords to COMMENT. This is useful when dealing
              with  ESO  FITS  files which contain this non-standard FITS fea-
              ture.  ado_refits keeps the same header by default, and converts
              these  keywords  to  COMMENTs  for compatibility with other FITS
              readers.

Examples
       All files are in current directory, to overwrite them  with  reformated
       data, just use:

       ado_refits *.fits

       All  files  are  in  directory  /dev/cdrom/adonis,  to output the newly
       reformated files in /space/data, you would do:

       % cd /space/data
       % ado_refits /dev/cdrom/adonis/*.fits

Files
       Input files are in Adonis FITS format

       Output files are (hopefully) FITS compliant. They do  not  contain  the
       time  information  in  the  planes  anymore,  but  directly in the FITS
       header.  Time information is added at the end, under HISTORY  keywords.
       Use  the  dfits  utility to visualize them, output them to a text file,
       etc.

Bugs
       The FITS reader implemented in eclipse has  been  enhanced  to  support
       common  errors made in FITS writing. Nevertheless, these errors have to
       be reported to the user, and they are in verbose mode. Reporting  these
       FITS  errors to the originators of the files could help a lot improving
       the quality of these files.

       Typically, the most common reported error is:
       *** Invalid format : using STRING
       which is generated for illegal keyword values such as:
       DOOR    = Opened
       which should be:
       DOOR    = ’Opened’
