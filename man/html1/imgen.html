Name
       imgen - image generation

Synopsis
       imgen [commands]

Description
       imgen  creates  images  with  a  given pattern definition and according
       parameters.  Since nearly all astronomical software packages have  very
       extended  image  generation capabilities, imgen is deliberately limited
       to very simple patterns. See the commands  below  for  pattern  defini-
       tions.

       In  all options, whenever a reference is made to pixel coordinates, the
       FITS convention is used: the first image pixel is at coordinates  (1,1)
       in  the lower left corner of the image. Increasing x go right, increas-
       ing y go up.

Image Generation Specifications
       -x value -y value
              to specify the generated image size (NAXIS1,NAXIS2). Defaults to
              256x256.

       -b or --bitsperpix value
              to request another pixel depth than the default one. The default
              output pixel type is chosen at compilation time: it  is  -32  if
              you did not request anything, -64 if you requested double preci-
              sion format for internal pixel representation.  Possible  values
              correspond  to  pixel  depth  in the FITS definition: 8, 16, 32,
              -32, or -64.

       -o or --output name
              gives a name to the output image. Default is â€™out.fitsâ€™.

       -S name or --ref name
              gives the program a reference FITS file name  which  the  output
              image  will  match in size. This option may not be used together
              with the -x or -y options.

Theoretical Images
       -a or --airy â€™width max dx dyâ€™
              to create an Airy pattern, of given width (in  pixels),  maximum
              pixel  value  at  the  peak, and given dx, dy offset. The offset
              indicates where should the real peak be situtated from the  cen-
              ter of the image. dx and dy are given in pixels from the center,
              axes comply with the FITS standard. Enclose  the  four  required
              parameters into simple quotes.

       -g or --gauss â€™x-center y-center sigmaâ€™
              to create a gaussian pattern centered on (x-center, y-center) of
              standard deviation sigma.

       -l or --lorentz â€™x-center y-center intensity dispersionâ€™
              to create a lorentzian pattern centered on (x-center,  y-center)
              with  intensity  and  dispersion strictly positive real numbers.
              the formula used is pixel value equals intensity over  one  plus
              dispersion  times  the square of the distance of the given pixel
              to the center of the distribution (x-center,y-center).

       -p â€™m1 m2 w0 dw pixelscaleâ€™
              to generate a optical transfer function for  a  given  telescope
              and  camera  configuration.  Enclose  the 5 requested parameters
              into simple quotes.  The parameters are respectively:

       The diameter of the primary mirror of the telescope in meters (m1).
       The diameter of the secondary mirror of the telescope in meters (m2).
       The central wavelength of observation (w0) in microns.
       The filter bandwidth (dw) in microns.
       The pixel scale on the sky (pixelscale) in arcseconds.

       All these values can be defaulted to the ESO 3.6m la  Silla  telescope,
       which are:

       m1 = 3.60 m
       m2 = 1.57 m
       w0 = 2.20 um
       dw = 0.30 um
       pixelscale = 0.05 arcseconds

       An input value of -1 means: use a default value.

       OTFâ€™s  are square images, only the x-size parameter will be used to set
       the image size, the y-parameter being discarded.

       An alternate form uses long options: --otf requires the OTF.  Telescope
       parameters  are  set  by  --m1,  --m2, --lambda0, --dlambda, and --pix-
       elscale.

       -t â€™m1 m2 w0 dw pixelscaleâ€™
              to generate a theoretical PSF for a given  telescope  configura-
              tion.  See option above, parameters are set as for OTF.

       PSFâ€™s  are square images, only the x-size parameter will be used to set
       the image size, the y-parameter being discarded.

       An alternate form uses long options: --psf requires the PSF.  Telescope
       options  are  as  above  for  OTF: --m1, --m2, --lambda0, --dlambda and
       --pixelscale.

Random Patterns
       -r â€™U min maxâ€™ or --urandom â€™min maxâ€™
              to create an image containing noise having a uniform probability
              distribution in the pixel value interval [min,max].

       -r â€™G mean sigmaâ€™ or --grandom â€™mean sigmaâ€™
              to  create an image containing noise having a gaussian probabil-
              ity distribution centered around mean and having a  sigma  value
              of  sigma.  The default value for sigma is 1/sqrt(2), it will be
              used if a negative value is provided.

       -r â€™L mean dispersionâ€™ or --lrandom â€™mean dispâ€™
              to create an image containing noise having a  lorentzian  proba-
              bility  distribution centered around mean with a dispersion fac-
              tor being dispersion.  The default value of 1.0 will be used for
              dispersion if a negative value is provided.

Binary Patterns
       -d or --bdisk â€™x-center y-center radiusâ€™
              to  create a binary disk, centered in the image at point (x-cen-
              ter, y-center) , having a radius of radius.  Center  coordinates
              and  radius  are  not restricted to integer values.  The disk is
              generated as white (1) on a black (0) background. The output can
              only  be  generated  in  FITS 8bit/pel format. A perfectly valid
              alternative long options is --bdisk â€™x0 y0 râ€™.

       -R or --brect â€™llx lly urx uryâ€™
              to create a binary rectangle, of lower left corner  situated  in
              (llx,  lly)  and upper right corner situated in (urx, ury).  The
              given corners are included in the rectangle.  The  rectangle  is
              generated as white (1) on a black (0) background. The output can
              only be generated in FITS 8bit/pel  format.  A  perfectly  valid
              alternative long option is --brect â€™llx lly urx uryâ€™.

       -u or --uniform value
              to create a uniform (flat) image of given pixel value.

       --poly2 â€™c0 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5â€™
              This option will create an image of a 2nd degree polynomial in x
              and y.  The coefficients given are in the following order:
              c[0] * x^2
              c[1] * y^2
              c[2] * x * y
              c[3] * x
              c[4] * y
              c[5] * 1

       The coordinate system used for the polynomial is the one  used  by  the
       FITS convention: pixel (1,1) is at the bottom left of the image, x-axis
       increasing from left to right and y-axis increasing from bottom to top.

       -P or --polygon filename
              This  option allows to create binary maps that contain polygons.
              This option expects a filename in  input  on  the  command-line.
              This  file  contains  the  definition  of  all the polygons that
              should be created in the binary map. The format is  the  follow-
              ing:

       Â*      The polygon definition file is an ASCII file.

       Â*      In  this file, blank lines or lines starting with a hash (#) are
              simply ignored (comments).

       Â*      Polygons are given by an ordered list of vertices. Each  vertice
              is  defined  by  a  set  of two coordinates in floating-point or
              integer format (both are supported). The polygon is drawn start-
              ing from the first point given in the list (from left to right),
              ending with the last point on the line and coming  back  to  the
              first point.

       Â*      Polygons  must  have  at least 3 vertices. Special cases are not
              tested, e.g. when all points are aligned.

       Here is an example of a polygon definition file, defining some  rectan-
       gles in a 256x256 binary map:

       #
       # Example of polygon definition file.
       #
       128 10 246 128 128 246 10 128
       10 10 90 10 90 90 10 90
       150 30 210 40 210 240 150 230
       20.4 217.25 82.31 233.98 68.67 195.2 32.0 175.6 14 190
       # end of file

       To  create  the  binary  map  from  this  file  (assuming  you named it
       poly.def), use:

       % imgen -P poly.def

Files
       Input/output files shall all comply with FITS format.
