Name
       setpix - batch command to set pixel values from a list in a text file

Synopsis
       setpix [options] &lt;in&gt; [out]

Description
       setpix  takes  a  list of 2-d pixel positions and pixel values, and the
       name of a FITS file (a data cube, an image, a pixel  map  or  an  ASCII
       list).  For a given image, it goes to all requested pixel positions and
       changes the pixel value to the one requested in the list. For  a  cube,
       the  process  is  repeated identically over all the planes in the file.
       For an ASCII list, the process is repeated over all planes in the  list
       and  the  output  is  a  single  FITS file with multiple planes (i.e. a
       cube).

       Example:
       The text file ’regions.txt’ contains the following data:
       ----- begin regions.txt -----
       #
       # file: regions.txt
       # defines pixels to be set
       #
       1 1 0.0
       128 128 100.0
       256 256 1000.0
       ----- end regions.txt   -----

       Using the following command:
       % setpix -f regions.txt image1.fits
       would make the following changes in the image ’image1.fits’:

       pixel value at position (1,1) is changed to 0.0
       pixel value at position (128,128) is changed to 100.0
       pixel value at position (256,256) is changed to 1000.0

       The text file specifying pixel positions and pixel values respects  the
       following syntax rules:

       Any line beginning with a hash (#) is a comment, thus not processed.

       Pixel  positions are given as integer values. They follow the FITS con-
       vention for pixel positions: first pixel of the  image  is  located  at
       coordinates  (1,1) in the lower left corner of the image. X is increas-
       ing from left to right, Y from bottom to top.

       Pixel values are given as floating point numbers. For pixel maps, these
       values  are  rounded up to the nearest integer value lower than the one
       requested.

       Default  output  file  name   for   a   file   named   ’file.fits’   is
       ’file_set.fits’.

Options
       -f regions.txt
              Declares  the  name  of  the file containing pixel positions and
              values. Default name for this file is "pts.txt".

Files
       Data files shall all comply with FITS format

       The list of pixel positions and values is a text file,  respecting  the
       syntax described above.
