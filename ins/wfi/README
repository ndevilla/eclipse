Wide Field Imager Reduction recipes
-----------------------------------


The recipes found in this directory have been written in the context of the
BeoWFI project, aimed at providing a data reduction facility for the WFI
instrument based on a Beowulf cluster.

The recipe functionalities are drawn from the eclipse library. The recipe
code has been written by N. Devillard, based on inputs from Aniello Grado,
Andreas Wicenec, Stefan Bogun, Miguel Albrecht, Peter Quinn. The Beowulf
demonstration cluster at ESO is maintained by Dieter Suchar and Andreas
Wicenec.
