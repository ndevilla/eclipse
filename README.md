# eclipse
Astronomical image processing suite

eclipse (ESO C Library for an Image Processing Environment) was developed
and supported from 1995 to 2003, and later transformed by ESO into the
Common Pipeline Library.

There are still many users of the original package out there, so the code
has been copied over github to offer another source as the ESO ftp server
is not guaranteed to live forever.

These sources are currently not maintained though. Use them at your own risk!
