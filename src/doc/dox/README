eclipse documentation
---------------------

The eclipse source code is documented directly in the .h and .c files.
Documentation in the sources follows the conventions set by doxygen.

Before going any further, it is recommended to download doxygen and read
carefully its (short) documentation. The conventions used to document
eclipse code are described hereafter. Get the latest doxygen version
from  http://www.doxygen.org

Conventions used by doxygen are almost identical to the JavaDoc
conventions, which means that if doxygen ever dies, it should still be
possible to locate some similar software to produce documentation.

Documentation is produced in eclipse/doc/reference
in:

html/ for the HTML doc
latex/ for the Latex doc

Generating the documentation
----------------------------

Type:
% doxygen eclipse.dox


Documentation conventions
-------------------------

All functions, typedefs, global variables, defines and modules must be
documented. Standard documentation templates can be found in the 'forge'
module inside the same CVS repository as eclipse.

Here is an example:

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
/**
  @brief    Integer image constructor.
  @param    lx      Size in x.
  @param    ly      Size in y.
  @return   1 newly allocated intimage.
 
  Allocates the main pointer and the pixel buffer, and returns the newly
  allocated object. The returned image must be deallocated using
  intimage_del().
 */
/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/


Allocated memory and documentation
----------------------------------

Functions that allocate memory and return a pointer to the allocated zone
MUST explicitly describe in their documentation how the pointer is supposed
to be deallocated. This can be as simple as "the returned pointer must be
deallocated using free()", but can also refer to object destructors. If the
returned pointer points to a statically allocated zone, this must be
indicated in the function documentation also. Freeing a statically
allocated pointer is a sure way of producing a core dump.
