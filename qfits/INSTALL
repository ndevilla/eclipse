Installing qfits as an ANSI C library
-------------------------------------

	% ./configure
	% make

	That should do it. You should now have a library called
	libqfits.a in the lib/ directory, and the include files
	you need are in the include/ directory.

	To review possible configure options, type:
	% configure --help

	To install this library system-wide, use:
	% make install
	
	This will install the library in /usr/local. To change the
	destination, use the --prefix option from configure.
	Example: to install under /usr/local/qfits you would do:
	% configure --prefix=/usr/local/qfits

	If you want to perform basic tests, use:
	% make check


Using qfits from C++
--------------------

Compile the C library with a C compiler and link your C++ program
against libqfits.a. It is not recommended to compile qfits with a
C++ compiler. Although this probably works, C code is not C++
code and you may run into trouble depending on the C++ compiler
you have.


Installing qfits as a Python module
-----------------------------------

	See python/README in this directory.


Using qfits from other languages
--------------------------------

This used to be offered through a SWIG interface file, but
is not supported any more. If you want to interface qfits to e.g.
scripting languages like Perl or Tcl, check out SWIG at
http://www.swig.org
